# Data Collection and Description

## Data Collection

The dataset used for this recommendation system project is sourced from [insert source here, e.g., Kaggle, company database, etc.]. The dataset is stored in the `data/raw/dataset.csv` file and contains [insert number of records] records and [insert number of features] features. 

The data collection process involved [describe the data collection process, e.g., scraping, API usage, manual collection, etc.]. The dataset includes various attributes that are relevant to the recommendation system, such as:

- **Feature 1**: Description of feature 1.
- **Feature 2**: Description of feature 2.
- **Feature 3**: Description of feature 3.
- [Add more features as necessary]

## Data Description

The dataset consists of the following key features:

1. **Feature 1**: [Description of feature 1, including data type and any relevant statistics]
2. **Feature 2**: [Description of feature 2, including data type and any relevant statistics]
3. **Feature 3**: [Description of feature 3, including data type and any relevant statistics]
4. **Feature 4**: [Description of feature 4, including data type and any relevant statistics]
5. **Feature 5**: [Description of feature 5, including data type and any relevant statistics]
6. [Continue listing features as necessary]

The target variable for the recommendation system is [insert target variable], which is used to generate recommendations based on user preferences and historical data.

## Data Quality Assessment

Before proceeding with the analysis, a preliminary assessment of the data quality was conducted. This included checking for:

- Missing values: [Insert findings on missing values]
- Duplicates: [Insert findings on duplicates]
- Outliers: [Insert findings on outliers]
- Data types: [Insert findings on data types]

The data was cleaned and processed to ensure that it is suitable for analysis and modeling. The cleaned and processed dataset is saved in the `data/processed/processed_data.csv` file. 

In summary, the dataset provides a comprehensive foundation for building a recommendation system, with relevant features that can be leveraged to generate meaningful recommendations for users.
